Welcome to Chapter 1.1! In this sub-chapter, we're going to introduce something that *can* be a bit scary, but it'll end up being your best friend in not only *this* programming language, **but in programming in general**: **The Terminal**.

## What is the Terminal?

The Terminal (also known as "The Command Prompt" in some Operating Systems), is a program where you type commands that your computer is going to follow.

**Visual Examples:**

That is what it does, and its in any device that you can find: computers, cellphones and even videogame consoles!

Depending of your device, the Terminal can be either really hidden and hard to access, or really easy by just looking it up in a Search Bar.

Since we're on a computer, **on most Operating Systems (*Windows, MacOS, Linux, etc.*) its pretty easy to find**.

***Example: on Windows 10, you can find the Terminal pretty easily by just typing "Command Prompt" on the Search Bar:***

## What's the use of the Terminal?

In programming, the Terminal is used a lot for tools.

And we're gonna use those tools to access the commands and programs that will allow you to **create our own programs**.

**The Command Prompt is the one that holds everything together in the world of programming** and Nucleus is not an exception.

## Is it used *only* for programming?

Not at all, for example, its used to:

- **Set up Servers.**
	
	If you ever tried to set up a Minecraft Server to play with your friends, you'll probably came across with this.

- **Configure, Customize or Fix Operating Systems.**

	On Windows for example, if your PC starts to get critical errors from time to time, you use the Terminal to fix those issues.

- **and more...**
