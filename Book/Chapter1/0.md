# Chapter 1: Introduction

![Hello! Welcome!](./Resources/1.svg)

...to the wonderful **Nucleus Programming Language Book**!

![This is Willy!](./Resources/2.svg)

**Willy** is a little guy that is going to be present in the illustrations of the book :D

## Why is the Book starting like this?

Well, its cool to have a pretty comfy introduction, so why not by introducing one of the greatest characters of all time!

**Isn't that right Willy?!**

**THAT'S THE SPIRIT! :D**

## So, what is the book about?

The book is going to guide and teach you how the Nucleus Programming Language works, from **zero**.

This means that we're going through all the process of teaching you how the **Command Prompt** or **Terminal** works, how you can code and make programs by using it, and of course, how to code with Nucleus!

**Willy** (and other characters later on) are going to be used to illustrate complex situations and make them easier to understand, and also some storytelling! :D
