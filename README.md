# Welcome to the Nucleus Programming Book!

This book is an all-in-one **Book, Manual and Documentation** about the **Nucleus Programming Language**!

In this book, you can learn not only **how the programming language works**, but also **how to code and understand how computers work, including yours**!

The target audience of this book is **from expert programmers, to people that don't know even how the terminal works**. So, if you're interested in learning programming in general, this will help you a lot! :D

So, **without further ado**... If you want to get started and have zero experience in programming, you'll start from the first chapter of the book!

[Chapter 1: Introduction](Book/Chapter1/0.md)

If you **already have experience with programming**, you can skip the introduction part and start from this chapter.
